# Product Context

## Purpose
The PPTX Generator exists to solve the challenge of automating PowerPoint presentation creation while maintaining consistency in branding and layout. It serves users who need to generate multiple presentations efficiently from structured data.

**Current Demo Phase:**  
Currently, the tool uses a predefined JSON file to populate a PowerPoint template, focusing on validating the generation logic and template mapping.

**Future Vision:**  
The ultimate goal is to allow users to supply a block of text or a markdown file. The system will use AI to analyze and segment the content, select optimal layouts, and generate the intermediate JSON data file for presentation generation.
