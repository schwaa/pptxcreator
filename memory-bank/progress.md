# Project Progress

## Current Focus
Core text-based presentation generation functionality is stable. The focus is now on **refining image handling, enhancing overall robustness, and significantly expanding test coverage.**

## Completed Items
1.  **Project Setup**
    *   ✅ Initial repository structure
    *   ✅ Basic documentation framework
    *   ✅ Memory bank initialization
    *   ✅ Core dependencies identified
2.  **Architecture & Core Implementation**
    *   ✅ Three-component design finalized (`analyzer.py`, `processor.py`, `generator.py`, `main.py`).
    *   ✅ Data contract specifications for `layouts.json` and `presentation.json`.
    *   ✅ `analyzer.py`: Successfully analyzes templates and generates `layouts.json` (including `source_template_path`).
    *   ✅ `processor.py`:
        *   Successfully processes markdown and `layouts.json` (layout definitions) using LLM.
        *   Generates `presentation.json` with correct `"placeholders"` key for content.
        *   Handles stringified lists from LLM using `ast.literal_eval`.
        *   Includes a basic fallback parser.
    *   ✅ `generator.py`:
        *   Successfully loads template (path from `layouts.json` via `main.py`) and `presentation.json`.
        *   Correctly populates slides with text content by matching placeholder names.
        *   Handles single string and list-of-strings content.
        *   Basic image placeholder handling (uses string as alt-text if image file not found).
    *   ✅ `main.py`:
        *   CLI commands (`analyze`, `process`, `generate`) implemented and functional.
        *   Correctly orchestrates data flow between components.
3.  **Key Bug Fixes:**
    *   ✅ Resolved "blank slides" issue by correcting key access in `generator.py` (from `"content"` to `"placeholders"`).
    *   ✅ Resolved issues with LLM output parsing in `processor.py`.
    *   ✅ Ensured correct template path sourcing in `main.py` for the `generate` command.

## In Progress
1.  **Memory Bank Update:**
    *   ✅ All memory bank files updated to reflect current project state and learnings (as of this update).
2.  **Image Handling Refinement:**
    *   🔄 Actively defining strategy and planning implementation for robust image path specification and embedding.
3.  **Testing Framework & Coverage:**
    *   🔄 Expanding unit and integration tests.

## Pending Tasks (Major Next Steps)

### Phase 1: Enhancements & Testing (Core functionality stable)
1.  **Image Handling Implementation (Primary Focus)**
    *   ⏳ Define how image paths are specified in `content.md` and represented in `presentation.json`.
    *   ⏳ Update `processor.py` (LLM prompt and parsing) to correctly extract and structure image information.
    *   ⏳ Enhance `generator.py` for robust image finding (relative to project, `images/` folder, absolute paths) and embedding.
2.  **Testing Suite Expansion (High Priority)**
    *   ⏳ Write comprehensive unit tests for `analyzer.py`, `processor.py`, `generator.py`.
    *   ⏳ Develop integration tests for the full `analyze` -> `process` -> `generate` workflow.
    *   ⏳ Test with various templates and content types (including images once implemented).
3.  **Error Handling & Robustness (Ongoing Refinement)**
    *   ⏳ Review and improve error messages across all components for clarity and actionability.
    *   ⏳ Strengthen validation for `layouts.json` and `presentation.json` if new edge cases are found.
    *   ⏳ Improve fallback mechanisms where appropriate.

### Documentation
1.  **User Guide Updates**
    *   ⏳ Update installation, usage examples, template requirements, and content guidelines (especially for images).
2.  **API Documentation**
    *   ⏳ Ensure component interfaces, data schemas, and error codes are well-documented.

## Known Issues
1.  **Image Handling:** Current implementation is very basic (treats image placeholder content as text if an image file is not found by its descriptive name). This is the **primary area for upcoming development.**
2.  **Test Coverage:** While core functionality is stable, comprehensive automated test coverage (unit and integration) is still being expanded.
3.  **Advanced Placeholder Types:** Support for charts, tables, and other complex content types is not yet implemented and remains a future enhancement.

## Next Milestones

### v0.2.0 - Core Functionality Complete (✅ Achieved)
- ✅ `analyze`, `process`, `generate` commands functional for text-based content.
- ✅ Text content (including lists) successfully populated in presentations.
- ✅ LLM integration for content structuring and layout mapping is operational.
- ✅ Data flow between components and JSON contracts (`layouts.json`, `presentation.json`) are stable.

### v0.3.0 - Robust Image Handling & Comprehensive Testing (Current Target)
- 🎯 Implement robust image path specification, processing, and embedding.
- 🎯 Significantly increase unit and integration test coverage.
- 🎯 Continue refining error handling and user experience.
- Target: Next 1-2 weeks.

### v0.4.0 - Advanced Features & Documentation
- Explore support for other placeholder types (e.g., charts from data).
- Complete user and developer documentation.
- Target: Following 2 weeks.

## Future Enhancements
(As previously listed, e.g., custom layout detection, template suggestions, batch processing, performance optimizations, interactive CLI.)
