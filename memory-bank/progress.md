# Project Progress

## Current Focus
Core text-based presentation generation functionality is stable. The primary focus is now on **Architectural Refactoring of `processor.py` to an Agentic Workflow using Pydantic models and `pydantic-ai` (or relevant Pydantic AI modules).** This is a foundational change to improve reliability and enable more intelligent features.

## Completed Items
1.  **Project Setup**
    *   ✅ Initial repository structure
    *   ✅ Basic documentation framework
    *   ✅ Memory bank initialization
    *   ✅ Core dependencies identified
2.  **Architecture & Core Implementation**
    *   ✅ Three-component design finalized (`analyzer.py`, `processor.py`, `generator.py`, `main.py`).
    *   ✅ Data contract specifications for `layouts.json` and `presentation.json`.
    *   ✅ `analyzer.py`: Successfully analyzes templates and generates `layouts.json` (including `source_template_path`).
    *   ✅ `processor.py`:
        *   Successfully processes markdown and `layouts.json` (layout definitions) using LLM.
        *   Generates `presentation.json` with correct `"placeholders"` key for content.
        *   Handles stringified lists from LLM using `ast.literal_eval`.
        *   Includes a basic fallback parser.
    *   ✅ `generator.py`:
        *   Successfully loads template (path from `layouts.json` via `main.py`) and `presentation.json`.
        *   Correctly populates slides with text content by matching placeholder names.
        *   Handles single string and list-of-strings content.
        *   Basic image placeholder handling (uses string as alt-text if image file not found).
    *   ✅ `main.py`:
        *   CLI commands (`analyze`, `process`, `generate`) implemented and functional.
        *   Correctly orchestrates data flow between components.
3.  **Key Bug Fixes:**
    *   ✅ Resolved "blank slides" issue by correcting key access in `generator.py` (from `"content"` to `"placeholders"`).
    *   ✅ Resolved issues with LLM output parsing in `processor.py`.
    *   ✅ Ensured correct template path sourcing in `main.py` for the `generate` command.

## In Progress
1.  **Memory Bank Update:**
    *   ✅ All memory bank files being updated to reflect the planned agentic architecture (as of this update).
2.  **Agentic Workflow Refactoring (`processor.py`):**
    *   🔄 Planning and documenting the refactor of `processor.py` to an agentic workflow with Pydantic models (`SlidePlan`, `FinalSlide`) and `pydantic-ai`.
    *   🔄 Defining new Pydantic models in `pptx_generator/models.py`.

## Pending Tasks (Major Next Steps)

### Phase 1: Agentic Workflow Implementation (Current Primary Focus)
1.  **Implement Agentic `processor.py`:**
    *   ⏳ Create `pptx_generator/models.py` with `ImageGenerationRequest`, `SlidePlan`, `FinalSlide` Pydantic models.
    *   ⏳ Implement `call_planning_llm` in `processor.py` using `pydantic-ai` to return `SlidePlan`.
    *   ⏳ Implement `call_designer_llm` in `processor.py` using `pydantic-ai` to return `FinalSlide`.
    *   ⏳ Refactor `process_content` loop in `processor.py` to use the new agentic, two-pass LLM calls.
    *   ⏳ Update `presentation.json` generation to use `FinalSlide.model_dump()`.
    *   ⏳ Add `pydantic` and `pydantic-ai` to `requirements.txt`.
2.  **Testing Suite Expansion (Post-Agentic Refactor):**
    *   ⏳ Write unit tests for `pptx_generator/models.py`.
    *   ⏳ Write unit tests for `call_planning_llm` and `call_designer_llm` (mocking LLM calls).
    *   ⏳ Update/create integration tests for the `process` command to validate the new workflow.
3.  **Image Handling Refinement (Post-Agentic Refactor):**
    *   ⏳ Leverage `ImageGenerationRequest` from `SlidePlan` and image path in `FinalSlide`.
    *   ⏳ Enhance `generator.py` for robust image file location and embedding based on paths from `presentation.json`.
4.  **Error Handling & Robustness (Ongoing Refinement):**
    *   ⏳ Integrate Pydantic validation errors into user feedback.
    *   ⏳ Review and improve error messages related to the new agentic flow.

### Documentation
1.  **User Guide Updates**
    *   ⏳ Update installation, usage examples, template requirements, and content guidelines (especially for images).
2.  **API Documentation**
    *   ⏳ Ensure component interfaces, data schemas, and error codes are well-documented.

## Known Issues
1.  **Image Handling:** Current implementation is very basic (treats image placeholder content as text if an image file is not found by its descriptive name). This is the **primary area for upcoming development.**
2.  **Test Coverage:** While core functionality is stable, comprehensive automated test coverage (unit and integration) is still being expanded.
3.  **Advanced Placeholder Types:** Support for charts, tables, and other complex content types is not yet implemented and remains a future enhancement.

## Next Milestones

### v0.2.0 - Core Functionality Complete (✅ Achieved)
- ✅ `analyze`, `process`, `generate` commands functional for text-based content.
