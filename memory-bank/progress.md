# Project Progress

## Current Focus
Core functionality for the three-component architecture (`analyze`, `process`, `generate`) is complete, with the system now generating PPTX files with content. Focus is shifting to refining image handling, enhancing robustness, and expanding test coverage.

## Completed Items
1.  **Project Setup**
    *   ‚úÖ Initial repository structure
    *   ‚úÖ Basic documentation framework
    *   ‚úÖ Memory bank initialization
    *   ‚úÖ Core dependencies identified
2.  **Architecture & Core Implementation**
    *   ‚úÖ Three-component design finalized (`analyzer.py`, `processor.py`, `generator.py`, `main.py`).
    *   ‚úÖ Data contract specifications for `layouts.json` and `presentation.json`.
    *   ‚úÖ `analyzer.py`: Successfully analyzes templates and generates `layouts.json` (including `source_template_path`).
    *   ‚úÖ `processor.py`:
        *   Successfully processes markdown and `layouts.json` (layout definitions) using LLM.
        *   Generates `presentation.json` with correct `"placeholders"` key for content.
        *   Handles stringified lists from LLM using `ast.literal_eval`.
        *   Includes a basic fallback parser.
    *   ‚úÖ `generator.py`:
        *   Successfully loads template (path from `layouts.json` via `main.py`) and `presentation.json`.
        *   Correctly populates slides with text content by matching placeholder names.
        *   Handles single string and list-of-strings content.
        *   Basic image placeholder handling (uses string as alt-text if image file not found).
    *   ‚úÖ `main.py`:
        *   CLI commands (`analyze`, `process`, `generate`) implemented and functional.
        *   Correctly orchestrates data flow between components.
3.  **Key Bug Fixes:**
    *   ‚úÖ Resolved "blank slides" issue by correcting key access in `generator.py` (from `"content"` to `"placeholders"`).
    *   ‚úÖ Resolved issues with LLM output parsing in `processor.py`.
    *   ‚úÖ Ensured correct template path sourcing in `main.py` for the `generate` command.

## In Progress
1.  **Memory Bank Update:**
    *   üîÑ Updating all memory bank files to reflect current project state and learnings.
2.  **Image Handling Refinement:**
    *   üîÑ Planning improvements for robust image path specification and embedding.
3.  **Testing Framework & Coverage:**
    *   üîÑ Test structure setup.
    *   üîÑ Planning for comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Pending Tasks (Major Next Steps)

### Phase 1: Stabilization & Enhancement
1.  **Image Handling Implementation**
    *   ‚è≥ Define how image paths are specified in `content.md`.
    *   ‚è≥ Update `processor.py` (LLM prompt) to extract image filenames/paths.
    *   ‚è≥ Enhance `generator.py` for robust image finding (relative to project, `images/` folder, absolute) and embedding.
2.  **Testing Suite Expansion**
    *   ‚è≥ Write comprehensive unit tests for `analyzer.py`, `processor.py`, `generator.py`.
    *   ‚è≥ Develop integration tests for the full `analyze` -> `process` -> `generate` workflow.
    *   ‚è≥ Test with various templates and content types.
3.  **Error Handling & Robustness**
    *   ‚è≥ Review and improve error messages across all components.
    *   ‚è≥ Strengthen validation for `layouts.json` and `presentation.json`.
    *   ‚è≥ Improve fallback mechanisms.

### Documentation
1.  **User Guide Updates**
    *   ‚è≥ Update installation, usage examples, template requirements, and content guidelines (especially for images).
2.  **API Documentation**
    *   ‚è≥ Ensure component interfaces, data schemas, and error codes are well-documented.

## Known Issues
1.  **Image Handling:** Current implementation is basic (treats image placeholder content as text if image file not found by its descriptive name). This is the next major area for improvement.
2.  **Test Coverage:** While core functionality works, comprehensive automated tests are still needed.
3.  **Advanced Placeholder Types:** Support for charts, tables, etc., is not yet implemented.

## Next Milestones

### v0.2.0 - Core Functionality Complete (Achieved)
- ‚úÖ `analyze`, `process`, `generate` commands functional.
- ‚úÖ Text content successfully populated in presentations.
- ‚úÖ Basic LLM integration for content structuring.

### v0.3.0 - Robust Image Handling & Testing
- Implement robust image path specification and embedding.
- Significantly increase unit and integration test coverage.
- Refine error handling.
- Target: Next 1-2 weeks.

### v0.4.0 - Advanced Features & Documentation
- Explore support for other placeholder types (e.g., charts from data).
- Complete user and developer documentation.
- Target: Following 2 weeks.

## Future Enhancements
(As previously listed, e.g., custom layout detection, template suggestions, batch processing, performance optimizations, interactive CLI.)
