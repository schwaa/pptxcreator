# Project Rules and Conventions

## Code Structure and Organization
- Adhere strictly to the project structure defined in the instructions.
- Prioritize modularity: Separate core logic (`analyzer.py`, `processor.py`, `generator.py`) from Pydantic models (`models.py`), utilities (`utils.py`), and the CLI (`main.py`).
- Pydantic models for data validation and LLM interaction are defined in `pptx_generator/models.py`.
- When creating new files, ensure correct directory placement.

## Coding Standards
- Utilize the `pydantic-ai` library (or relevant modules from the Pydantic AI ecosystem) to ensure LLM outputs conform to predefined Pydantic models, enhancing reliability.
- Implement robust error handling for file operations (reading data, loading templates, saving output).
- Provide clear, actionable error messages.
- Ensure all Python code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Use f-strings for clear and efficient string formatting.
- Provide informative print statements for CLI user feedback and `logging` for internal/debug information.
- Use `ast.literal_eval` for safely parsing stringified Python literals (e.g., lists) from LLM responses.

## File and Path Handling
- Always use `os.path.join` for constructing paths to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
- `main.py` resolves template paths for `analyze` and `generate` commands.
    - `analyze` command: template can be a direct path or a name in `templates/`.
    - `generate` command: template path is sourced from `source_template_path` within the project's `layouts.json`.
- Image paths in `presentation.json` are currently relative and resolved by `generator.py` (basic resolution, needs enhancement).

## Dependencies and Environment
- When adding dependencies, specify them clearly in `requirements.txt`.
- The project uses OpenRouter for LLM access, specifically the model `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free`. Ensure all references to LLM services reflect this. The API key for OpenRouter should be configured in the `.env` file.
- The `openai` library is used as the client for OpenRouter.

## Documentation and Version Control
- Maintain a consistent and helpful tone in all user-facing output and documentation.
- For Git commits, use conventional commits (e.g., 'feat:', 'fix:', 'docs:') for clarity.

## JSON Data Structures
- **`layouts.json`**:
    - Root key: `"source_template_path"`: (string) path to the original template PPTX.
    - Root key: `"layouts"`: (array of objects)
        - Each object has `"name"`: (string) layout name.
        - Each object has `"placeholders"`: (array of strings) names of placeholders in that layout.
- **`presentation.json`**:
    - Root key: `"slides"`: (array of objects)
        - Each object has `"layout"`: (string) name of the layout to use.
        - Each object has `"placeholders"`: (dictionary)
            - Keys are placeholder names (string).
            - Values are content (string for single text, array of strings for bullet points/paragraphs, or string path for images if `FinalSlide` includes an image).
    - Each slide object in the `slides` array is a `FinalSlide.model_dump()`.

## Pytest Testing Conventions
- **File Naming:** Test files should be named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and located in the `tests/` directory.
- **Function Naming:** Test functions should be prefixed with `test_` (e.g., `def test_my_function():`).
- **Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
    - **Arrange:** Set up the test conditions.
    - **Act:** Execute the code being tested.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the outcome is as expected.
- **Assertions:** Use descriptive assertion messages.
- **Fixtures:** Use Pytest fixtures (`@pytest.fixture`) for reusable setup. Place fixture files in `tests/fixtures/`.
- **Clarity and Isolation:** Each test should be independent.
- **Running Tests:** From project root: `pytest`.

## Key Script Logic Points
- **`processor.py` (`process_content` - Agentic Workflow):**
    - Iterates through markdown chunks from `content.md`.
    - **Input per chunk:** Markdown text, `layouts_json` (for layout definitions).
    - **Step 1: Planning (`call_planning_llm`)**
        - Uses `pydantic-ai` (or relevant Pydantic AI modules) to call LLM, expecting a `SlidePlan` Pydantic model.
        - `SlidePlan` contains `slide_topic`, `content_type`, `raw_content`, and optional `image_request` (an `ImageGenerationRequest` Pydantic model with an image prompt).
    - **Step 2: Tool Use (Image Generation - Optional)**
        - If `SlidePlan.image_request` exists, `generate_and_save_image` is called.
        - Returns `image_path`.
    - **Step 3: Designing (`call_designer_llm`)**
        - Uses `pydantic-ai` (or relevant Pydantic AI modules) to call LLM with `SlidePlan`, optional `image_path`, and `layouts_json`.
        - Expects a `FinalSlide` Pydantic model.
        - `FinalSlide` contains `layout` (string) and `placeholders` (dict mapping placeholder names to content: text, list of text, or image path).
    - **Output:** `FinalSlide.model_dump()` is appended to the `slides` list for `presentation.json`.
- **`models.py`:**
    - Defines Pydantic models: `ImageGenerationRequest`, `SlidePlan`, `FinalSlide`.
- **`generator.py` (`generate_presentation`):**
    - Takes `presentation.json` path and `template_filepath` as direct arguments.
    - Iterates `presentation.json` slides.
    - For each slide, gets content from the `"placeholders"` dictionary.
    - Matches placeholder names from JSON to `shape.name` on the slide.
- **`main.py` (CLI):**
    - `analyze <project_name> <template_specifier>`: Creates `layouts.json` (includes `source_template_path`).
    - `process <project_name>`: Uses `content.md` and `layouts.json` (for layout definitions) to create `presentation.json`.
    - `generate <project_name>`: Uses `presentation.json` and gets `template_filepath` from `layouts.json`'s `source_template_path` key.
